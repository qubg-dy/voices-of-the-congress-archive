## British Mandate for Palestine
**Historical period**: 1920–1948  
**Definition**: A League of Nations mandate that granted Great Britain administrative control over Palestine following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after World War I. The Mandate incorporated the Balfour Declaration’s commitment to a “national home for the Jewish people” and became a central subject of Jewish‑Zionist advocacy as well as Arab‑Jewish conflict. The mandate ended with the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.

## Nuremberg Trials
**Historical period**: 1945–1946  
**Definition**: A series of military tribunals held after World War II to prosecute prominent leaders of Nazi Germany for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. The trials were a watershed moment in international law and were closely monitored by Jewish organizations, including the World Jewish Congress, which pushed for the inclusion of charges related to the persecution and murder of Jews (the Holocaust). The trials helped establish the principle that individuals can be held accountable for atrocities committed under state orders.

## World Jewish Congress (WJC)
**Founded**: 1936  
**Definition**: An international federation of Jewish communities and organizations founded in Geneva to defend the rights and interests of Jews worldwide. The WJC played a crucial role in mobilizing international opinion against Nazi Germany, in documenting war crimes, and in advocating for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. After the war, it continued to combat anti‑Semitism, promote Jewish cultural heritage, and represent Jewish concerns in international forums.
