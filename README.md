# Voices of the Congress Digital Archive

## Project Description
The "Voices of the Congress" digital archive is a collaborative initiative to preserve, transcribe, and publish key speeches, letters, and testimonials from the founding and early years of the World Jewish Congress. This project aims to make historically significant documents accessible to researchers, educators, and the public, ensuring that the stories of those who fought for Jewish rights and against anti‑Semitism in the aftermath of World War II are not forgotten.

## Mission
Our mission is to:
- Digitally preserve primary source materials from the World Jewish Congress’s formative period.
- Provide accurate, searchable transcriptions of speeches, letters, and testimonies.
- Foster a community of contributors who share a commitment to historical accuracy and ethical archival practices.
- Educate future generations about the foundations of international Jewish advocacy and the ongoing fight against bigotry.
