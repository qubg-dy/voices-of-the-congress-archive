## Opening Address to the World Jewish Congress, 1946

Fellow delegates, survivors, and friends,

We gather today in the shadow of an unparalleled catastrophe. The Jewish people have emerged from the war broken in body but unbroken in spirit. The horrors we have witnessed—the systematic murder of six million of our brothers and sisters—must never be forgotten, and must never be repeated.

Our first duty is to the living. We must secure a future for those who have survived. This means pressing the international community to open its doors to Jewish refugees, and to recognize the right of the Jewish people to a homeland in Palestine. The British Mandate authorities have betrayed the promise of the Balfour Declaration; we call upon them to end their restrictive policies and to allow free Jewish immigration.

Our second duty is to justice. The Nazi criminals who planned and executed the Holocaust must be brought to account. The Nuremberg Trials are a step in the right direction, but they are only a beginning. We demand that every perpetrator, from the highest leaders to the lowest guards, be hunted down and tried.

And our third duty is to ourselves. We must rebuild Jewish life—not only physically, but spiritually and culturally. The World Jewish Congress must become the voice of the Jewish people in the halls of power, but also the guardian of our heritage. Let us create institutions that will preserve our history, promote our culture, and educate our youth.

The road ahead is long and difficult. But if we stand together, with determination and with hope, we can ensure that the Jewish people not only survive, but thrive.
